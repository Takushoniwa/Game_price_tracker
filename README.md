# Game_price_tracker
This is my first real program developed using python. The application tracks the price of a specified game on the website https://uk.gamesplanet.com and sends you and email when the price falls below a set amount. I developed this program so as to ensure that i dont miss on game deals from https://uk.gamesplanet.com. The program checks the price of the desired game after every 12 hours. 

Steps:
1. If you are using gmail as the email address to recieve game discount notifications on, you first need to allow your gmail to recieve emails from less secure apps so that this program can notify you via eamil using smtp. Do this by clicking the allow button which will redirect you to your browser and on the google page enable the allow button.

2. Enter the email and password that you wish to recieve notifications on

3. Go to uk.gamesplanet.com and search for the game you wish to track and go to the game's page, for example the Fifa 20 page would be: https://uk.gamesplanet.com/game/fifa-20-origin--4344-1

4. Copy this link and paste it in the program where it says 'Gamesplanet game URL'

5. Run the program by clicking the track and notify button.
